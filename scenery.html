                <h3>Marina Bay Sands</h3>
                <p>
                  Marina Bay Sands is Singapore's most iconic integrated resort,
                  featuring world-class entertainment facilities and luxury
                  hotels. The three 55-story hotel towers are topped by the
                  spectacular Sands SkyPark, offering 360-degree panoramic
                  views. The resort includes a shopping mall, ArtScience Museum,
                  theaters, and Singapore's largest casino.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most famous infinity pool is located 57 floors above
                  ground, the world's largest elevated infinity pool. The pool
                  edge seems to merge with the city skyline, making it one of
                  the most popular Instagram spots. At night, visitors can enjoy
                  spectacular city light shows and musical fountain
                  performances. Marina Bay Sands has completely transformed
                  Singapore's skyline, perfectly combining modern architecture
                  with luxurious living.

                <h3>Merlion Park</h3>
                <p>
                  The Merlion is Singapore's most famous national icon and
                  tourism symbol. This 8.6-meter tall, 70-ton statue was
                  designed by sculptor Lim Nang Seng, combining a lion's head
                  with a fish's body. Located along Marina Bay, Merlion Park is
                  a must-visit spot for tourists, offering magnificent panoramic
                  views of the bay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to legend, in the 14th century, a prince discovered
                  this island while sailing and saw a mystical creature. His
                  attendants told him it was a lion, so he named the island
                  "Singapura" (Lion City). The water-spouting Merlion symbolizes
                  Singapore's transformation from a fishing village to a modern
                  metropolis. At night, the Merlion becomes even more
                  mysteriously charming under the lights.

                <h3>Sentosa Island</h3>
                <p>
                  Sentosa Island is Singapore's premier resort destination,
                  covering approximately 5 square kilometers. The island boasts
                  numerous world-class attractions including Universal Studios
                  Singapore, S.E.A. Aquarium, and Adventure Cove Waterpark.

                </p>
                <p>
                  "Sentosa" means "peace and tranquility" in Malay. The
                  southernmost point of the island marks the southernmost tip of
                  continental Asia. Visitors can reach the island via cable car
                  or by walking across the Sentosa Boardwalk. The Resorts World
                  Sentosa integrated resort offers diverse entertainment

                <h3>Gardens by the Bay</h3>
                <p>
                  Gardens by the Bay is Singapore's newest landmark attraction,
                  spanning 101 hectares across three waterfront gardens. The
                  most striking features are the 18 "Supertrees" ranging from
                  25-50 meters tall. These vertical gardens provide shade during
                  the day and transform into spectacular light show stages at
                  night. Two massive conservatories - Flower Dome and Cloud
                  Forest - showcase botanical wonders from around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Flower Dome is the world's largest columnless glass
                  greenhouse, recreating Mediterranean climates; the Cloud
                  Forest simulates tropical mountain environments with a
                  35-meter indoor waterfall. Gardens by the Bay perfectly
                  embodies Singapore's "City in a Garden" vision, skillfully
                  blending nature with technology. The aerial walkway connects
                  several Supertrees, allowing visitors to stroll 22 meters
                  above ground while enjoying panoramic city views.
