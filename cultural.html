          <p>
            Singapore is a nation of multicultural integration, where Chinese,
            Malay, Indian and Western cultures coexist harmoniously, creating a
            unique cultural landscape. The most typical representation of this
            cultural fusion is Peranakan Culture, also known as Nyonya Culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nyonya Culture originated in the 15th-16th centuries, formed through
            intermarriage between Chinese immigrants and Malay natives. In
            cuisine, Nyonya food combines Chinese cooking techniques with Malay
            spices, creating distinctive dishes like Laksa and Ayam Buah Keluak.
            Traditional Nyonya families still maintain the practice of manually
            grinding spices with stone mortars.
          </p>
          <p>
            In clothing culture, the Kebaya worn by Nyonya women perfectly
            combines Malay traditional dress with Chinese embroidery. These
            hand-sewn garments often take months to complete, while beaded shoes
            (Kasut Manek) require tens of thousands of tiny beads to be sewn by
            hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            In architecture, Singapore preserves many Nyonya-style shophouses
            that blend European neoclassicism with traditional Chinese
            decorative elements. Colorful tiles, intricate wooden screens and
            wrought iron railings are their typical features.
          </p>
          <p><img src="images/13.png" /></p>
          <p>
            Beyond Nyonya culture, Singapore also preserves rich Malay
            traditions. Kampong Gelam is the Malay cultural district, where the
            Sultan Mosque built in 1824 stands as Singapore's most important
            Islamic architecture. During Ramadan, the night market here is
            exceptionally lively.
          </p>

          <p>Indian Cultural Experience</p>
          <p>
            Little India is the perfect place to experience Indian culture. The
            Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple here is adorned with colorful Hindu
            deities. During Deepavali, the entire neighborhood is decorated with
            lights, filled with festive atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p><img src="images/14.png" /></p>
          <p>Chinese Traditional Culture</p>
          <p>
            Chinatown preserves strong Chinese traditions. The Buddha Tooth
            Relic Temple here has magnificent architecture, and during Lunar New
            Year, the entire neighborhood is decorated with red lanterns. During
            the Hungry Ghost Festival, street offerings can be seen everywhere,
            showcasing Chinese traditions of honoring ancestors.
          </p>
          <p>Modern Cultural Fusion</p>
          <p>
            Singapore's cultural vitality is also reflected in contemporary art.
            The National Gallery houses extensive Southeast Asian art
            collections, while Esplanade regularly hosts international
            performances. The annual Singapore Arts Festival brings together
            artists from around the world.
          </p>
          <p>Linguistic Characteristics</p>
          <p>
            Singapore's unique "Singlish" is a linguistic product of
            multicultural integration, blending English, Chinese, Malay and
            dialect vocabulary to form distinctive expressions that have become
            an important marker of Singaporean cultural identity.

      <br />
      <div class="center">
        This interactive project features a rule-based chatbot designed to guide
        users through choices related to travel and cuisine. The chatbot offers
        a multi-path dialogue experience by presenting preset options—such as
        “Visit Attractions” or “Try Local Cuisine.” When users click on
        different options, they are directed to corresponding video segments or
        content modules.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="center">
        Closely aligned with the website’s theme, the chatbot focuses on
        “Exploring Tourism and Cuisine in Singapore.” It encourages active user
        participation, enhancing immersion and interactivity. The chatbot does
        not rely on artificial intelligence but instead operates based on a
        clearly defined rule-based structure. Each branch option triggers a
        specific content path, helping users gain a deeper understanding and
        interest in the destination.
